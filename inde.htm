            <h1>10 Task Management Tips & Skills To Get More Done Today</h1>
            <div class="infolist">

                <h2>How do you manage tasks effectively? </h2>
                <h3>1. Break up big projects into smaller tasks</h3>
                <p>One of the easiest and most significant things one can do before undertaking a large project is to
                    break
                    it up into smaller parts. It may seem counter-intuitive to give yourself “more” tasks, but it’s
                    really
                    just a way to visualize a large-scope project, which can be overwhelming and stress-inducing, in
                    more
                    manageable and (more importantly) measurable chunks.

                    It’s vital to recognize the difference between the projects and create actionable plans in a form of
                    smaller chunks to achieve it.

                    Smaller tasks with clear completion criteria can make a project seem less daunting and boosts
                    motivation, effectively giving you greater confidence in your abilities beforehand, and then
                    reaffirming
                    them through lots of small victories along the way.

                    If your goal is to “be fluent in Spanish”, it would hardly do you much good to blindly stare at such
                    an
                    imposing goal. Instead, it would be much more productive to start with “introduce myself,” make the
                    process habitual, “learn 10 new words a day,” and ultimately a series of achievable milestones, each
                    one
                    bringing you closer to your goal.</p>

                <br>
                <h3>2. Create a priority to-do list</h3>
                <p>As intelligent a being we may be, it’s insanely difficult to mentally juggle many ideas
                    simultaneously.
                    Having your tasks as an easily accessible record helps you stay on top of things. A to-do list can
                    be as
                    simple as a piece of paper and some rapid logging, a digital planner, or even specialized project
                    management software. Regardless of whether it’s physical or digital, form the habit of adding items
                    as
                    they occur to you.

                    Creating a priority system brings added benefits, namely a clearer view of your most critical tasks,
                    but
                    also a sense of relief from knowing that you’re working on the right focus.</p>



                <div class="diagram">
                    <div class="urgent">
                        <p>Urgent</p>
                        <div class="do box">
                            <p>Do</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="deligate box">
                            <p>Deligate</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="noturgent">
                        <p>Not Urgent</p>
                        <div class="decide box">
                            <p>Decide</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="delete box">
                            <p>Delete</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>There’s quite a few priority to-do list approaches, but the Eisenhower matrix is a notable one,
                    allowing you to categorize tasks into four quadrants:

                    <br>1. Urgent and important: Do it immediately

                    <br>2. Important, but not urgent: Schedule time for it

                    <br>3. Urgent, not important: Delegate it

                    <br>4. Neither urgent nor important: Forget it
                </p>
                <h3>3. Keep your tasks in one place</h3>
                <p>Once you’ve decided on an effective method for recording tasks and responsibilities, make sure you’re
                    keeping it all in a single planner, otherwise there’s no real benefit to creating the to-do list at
                    all.
                    It gets complicated when your day is scattered here and there, in two notebooks, a phone, a
                    calendar, a
                    diary and a carrier pigeon.

                    Unifying everything under one planner is fundamentally faster because it eliminates the time wasted
                    when
                    physically switching between modalities, but also the cognitive time taken by the brain cognitively
                    resetting, too.

                    One place means one focus point, so it’s vastly easier to manage work and plan life. Friday's
                    planner
                    allows users to add tasks conveniently and schedule a block of time to complete them (with
                    reminders!),
                    making you that much likelier to commit to your goals.</p>
                <h3> 4. Set time limits and deadlines</h3>
                <p>As American writer Rita Mae Brown said, “A deadline is negative inspiration. Still, it's better than
                    no
                    inspiration at all.” It’s true; they aren’t amazingly fun but rather a fact of life. As painful as
                    they
                    may be, clear timeframes boost productivity.

                    Research has shown that we work harder when we are aware of deadlines, whilst the Yerkes–Dodson Law
                    has
                    suggested – for over a hundred years – a clear relationship between pressure and performance.

                    When it comes to setting a deadline, be sure to leave sufficient time to accommodate healthy working
                    practices. A deadline that requires you to work and work endlessly is, to put it nicely,
                    overly-ambitious or, not so nicely, dangerous.

                    Never sacrifice break times for an unrealistic workload, lest you begin to lose interest and resent
                    your
                    work and goals. The importance of not only being physically away from work, but also psychologically
                    detached has clearly been shown, so do not set yourself up for failure with impossible expectations.

                    It’s difficult to set a deadline on a project with no end-date in sight. Yet, it’s as simple as just
                    picking a finish line you’re comfortable with. In doing so, you feel as if you’re constantly working
                    towards a tangible end, boosting motivation by applying a healthy amount of pressure.

                    However, deadlines are not the only kind of time limit you need to be concerned with, but also
                    work-length. Something like the Pomodoro technique, a brilliantly basic work-rest pattern, keeps you
                    focused by providing your brain with adequate recovery time. An alternative technique is the 52/17
                    philosophy, which involves working for 52 minutes and taking a 17 minute break (reminiscent of our
                    natural 90/20 minute ultradian rhythm).

                    By “rewarding” yourself with a break, you can maintain motivation to get the tasks completed,
                    especially
                    useful when faced with extensive and complicated projects where prolonged focus is needed.</p>
